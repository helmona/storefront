In my new collection I'm trying to collect my memories, vibe of the cities and feeling from places where I spent some time, and “conserve it” into these decorative pieces.',

Like black and white in harmonious yin-yang, the whole creative process guided me into the circular particles, "O" and "D" shapes of very unique marble patterns made out of polymer clay. When I started to study a bit of geology and the process about how the original inorganics had melted together, it inspired me to create my own technique to reach a similar effect. Now, after months of experiments, I would like to proudly introduce you to my results.',
